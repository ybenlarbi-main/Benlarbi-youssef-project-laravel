## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Asset Compilation
```bash
npm run build  # Production build
php artisan config:cache  # Cache configuration
php artisan route:cache   # Cache routes
php artisan view:cache    # Cache views
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate  # Run all migrations
```

### Queue Workers (Optional)
For high-traffic sites, consider using queues for notifications:
```bash
php artisan queue:work  # Start queue worker
```

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 640px - Simplified layout, stacked elements
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1024px - Adapted spacing and layout
- **Desktop**: > 1024px - Full feature layout

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Touch Targets**: Properly sized buttons and interactive elements
- **Navigation**: Collapsible mobile menu
- **Performance**: Optimized images and minimal JavaScript
- **Gestures**: Swipe-friendly interface elements

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. The system uses existing Laravel configurations.

### Cache Settings
The notification system uses Laravel's built-in caching for optimal performance.
