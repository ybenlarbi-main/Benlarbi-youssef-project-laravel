# Like and Comment Features Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented like and comment functionality for posts in the Laravel social network application. Users can now:

- **Like/Unlike Posts**: Interactive heart button with real-time count updates
- **Comment on Posts**: Add, view, and delete comments with proper permissions
- **Real-time Updates**: AJAX-powered interactions without page reloads

## Features Implemented

### Database Schema
1. **Likes Table** (`likes`)
   - `id` (primary key)
   - `user_id` (foreign key to users)
   - `post_id` (foreign key to posts)
   - `timestamps`
   - Unique constraint on `(user_id, post_id)` to prevent duplicate likes

2. **Comments Table** (`comments`)
   - `id` (primary key)
   - `user_id` (foreign key to users)
   - `post_id` (foreign key to posts)
   - `content` (text)
   - `timestamps`
   - Index on `(post_id, created_at)` for better performance

### Models & Relationships
1. **Post Model** (`app/Models/Post.php`)
   - `likes()` - hasMany relationship
   - `comments()` - hasMany relationship
   - `isLikedBy(User $user)` - helper method
   - `getLikesCountAttribute()` - accessor
   - `getCommentsCountAttribute()` - accessor

2. **User Model** (`app/Models/User.php`)
   - `likes()` - hasMany relationship
   - `comments()` - hasMany relationship

3. **Like Model** (`app/Models/Like.php`)
   - `user()` - belongsTo relationship
   - `post()` - belongsTo relationship

4. **Comment Model** (`app/Models/Comment.php`)
   - `user()` - belongsTo relationship
   - `post()` - belongsTo relationship

### Controllers
1. **LikeController** (`app/Http/Controllers/LikeController.php`)
   - `store()` - Add like to post (POST `/posts/{post}/like`)
   - `destroy()` - Remove like from post (DELETE `/posts/{post}/like`)
   - JSON responses for AJAX requests
   - Authorization checks using PostPolicy

2. **CommentController** (`app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php`)
   - `store()` - Add comment to post (POST `/posts/{post}/comments`)
   - `destroy()` - Delete comment (DELETE `/comments/{comment}`)
   - Permission checks (author or post owner can delete)
   - JSON responses for AJAX requests

### Routes
Added to `routes/web.php`:
```php
// Likes
Route::post('/posts/{post}/like', [LikeController::class, 'store'])->name('posts.like');
Route::delete('/posts/{post}/like', [LikeController::class, 'destroy'])->name('posts.unlike');

// Comments
Route::post('/posts/{post}/comments', [CommentController::class, 'store'])->name('posts.comments.store');
Route::delete('/comments/{comment}', [CommentController::class, 'destroy'])->name('comments.destroy');
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### Posts Index View (`resources/views/posts/index.blade.php`)
- Interactive like button with heart icon (filled when liked)
- Real-time like count display
- Comment toggle button with count
- Collapsible comments section showing recent comments
- Comment form with user avatar
- AJAX functions for all interactions

#### Post Show View (`resources/views/posts/show.blade.php`)
- Full like/unlike functionality
- Complete comments section with all comments displayed
- Comment form for new comments
- Delete buttons for comment authors and post owners

#### JavaScript Functions
- `toggleLike(postId)` - Handle like/unlike with AJAX
- `toggleComments(postId)` - Show/hide comments section
- `submitComment(event, postId)` - Submit new comment via AJAX
- `deleteComment(commentId)` - Delete comment with confirmation

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Like button changes color (red) and fills heart icon when liked
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Real-time count updates
- Loading states and success/error messages

### Permissions
- Users can only like posts they can view (respects connection system)
- Comments can be deleted by:
  - Comment author
  - Post owner
- Proper authorization checks in controllers

### Responsive Design
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Consistent with existing design system
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes from the app's design

### Performance Optimizations
- Eager loading of relationships (`with(['user', 'likes', 'comments.user'])`)
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Unique constraints to prevent data inconsistency
- Efficient queries with count methods

## Testing the Features

1. **Like Functionality**:
   - Visit a post and click the heart button
   - Count should increase/decrease immediately
   - Button should change color and fill state
   - Refresh page to verify persistence

2. **Comment Functionality**:
   - Click comment button to expand comments section
   - Write a comment and submit
   - Comment should appear immediately at top
   - Try deleting your own comments
   - Try deleting comments as post owner

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Cannot like same post twice
   - Comments have 1000 character limit
   - Proper error messages for failures
   - Authorization prevents unauthorized actions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notifications**: Notify users when their posts are liked or commented on
2. **Comment Replies**: Add threading for comment responses
3. **Reaction Types**: Expand beyond just "like" (love, laugh, etc.)
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
5. **Comment Editing**: Allow users to edit their comments
6. **Mentions**: Tag other users in comments
7. **Image Comments**: Support for image attachments in comments
